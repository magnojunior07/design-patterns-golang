Some design patterns in Golang

## Creational Patterns
| Pattern | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
|[Factory](/creational/factory)|Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to change the type of objects that will be created.|
|[Abstract Factory](/creational/abstract%20factory)|Is a creational design pattern that allows you to produce families of related objects without having to specify their concrete classes.|
|[Builder](/creational/builder)|Is a creational design pattern that allows you to build complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code..|
