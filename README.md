## Creational Patterns

|[Factory](/creational/factory)|Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to change the type of objects that will be created.|
|[Abstract Factory](/creational/abstract%20factory)|Is a creational design pattern that allows you to produce families of related objects without having to specify their concrete classes.|
